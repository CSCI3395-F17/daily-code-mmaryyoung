Group Problems:

  1. station name: Rocky Point | time: 2017/08/02
  2. station name: Upper Tsaina River
  3. High Temperature Stdev: 12.68496759094494 
     Low Temperature Stdev: 11.645243635906198
  4. Number of stations: 13003

Individial Problems:

  1. 
    * a) <35: 8.34C , 35<x<42: 10.79C , 42<x: 12.90C
    * b) <35: 8.01C , 35<x<42: 9.91C , 42<x: 11.72C
    * c) ![<35](./plots/under35)
    ![35-42](./plots/35to42)

  3. 
    * a) Average of 1897: 10.67C | Average of 2016: 11.69C
    * b) Average of 1897: 10.59C | Average of 2016: 12.09C
    * c)![Average Temperature over Years 1](./plots/3c)
    * d)![Average Temperature over Years 2](./plots/3d)  
  4. Approach A is easier to code but many new stations are built over the 119 year span. Approach B produces more sensible results. Comparison can only be used to illustrate climate change if the data is collected by the same stations. However it takes longer to code and run approach B.
  5. I really did not find any flaw..
