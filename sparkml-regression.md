In order to predict peoples health condition based on other factors, my approach was to find every health related column and set them as features for a linear regression. Since people are too mediocre to assess their own health as anything other than "Good", the result of my linear regression is rather disappointing (See function regressionPredict). However, I managed to find the most influential column for each of the health assessment, by finding the highest corr. The results are rather interesting. 

General Health: CHECKUP1
Physical Health: CHECKUP1
Mental Health: CHCKIDNY
Poor Health: HAVARTH3
