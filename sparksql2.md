1.![Recession Histogram](./plots/recessionHistogram) After the recession, the unemployment rate became more varied among samples and also, in general, rose a bit.The two most dramatic recessions were the 1990 one and the 2008 one.
2. 
    a) The number I calculated was 0.16672925713741318. It means the democratic votes and unemployment have a positive correlation with each other, but it is not significant enough to be indicative of a trend.
    b)   ![Unemployment Vs. Democratic Rate](./plots/democratUnemployment) Counties with a lower population clearly tend to vote for democrats less, while larger counties have a higher percentage of democrat votes. There is not a strong correlation between unemployment rate and percentage of democratic votes, although it seems that most counties vote 50% or less for democrats.
3. ![Turnout Vs. Democratic Rate Vs. Unemployment](./plots/turnoutDemEmployment) It is subtle, so it may not be statistically significant, but it seems that the areas with higher turnout (denoted by red dots) have higher unemployment, and those with lower turnout (blue and green dots) have lower unemployment. However, overall, it is not a clear trend.
